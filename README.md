# [Network Automation?](https://python-automation-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Network automation is the process of automating a computer network's configuration, management and operations. The tasks usually done by the network or system administrator can be automated using several tools and technologies.

Scripting languages are widely used by Network and System administrators for automating tasks. This saves time, and effort and thereby reduces human errors as well. Among the automation tools, Python and Ansible are the most popular ones. With Software Defined Networking (SDN) in picture, knowing any of these programming languages is vital for the future of administering the network and systems.
