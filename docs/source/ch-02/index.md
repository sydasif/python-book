# 2. Basic of Python

This chapter focuses on the basic fundamentals of the Python programming language that are needed to write a program or a script. Python has different data types, sets, strings, lists and dicts that are important in programming. Lists store sequence of objects in an order and iterate over the list.

Variables in Python mainly refer to the storage location. These variables can be assigned one or more values. Python also has several data types including numeric data types. There are also a set of characters called strings that are contained in Python.

Lists in Python are sequences of ordered elements that are mutable. Sets, on the other hand, are Python collection of unordered elements that are immutable. Tuples are also Python elements that describe immutable objects but uses parenthesis.

There are several very useful data types used in Python Scripting namely String, Numbers, Lists, Sets, Tuples and Dictionaries. All these elements of Python programming work together in meeting the needs of different programmers in the programming work. These elements help in creating effective Python programs used in several applications.

A python data type is a set/group of values with similar characteristics. Data types can belong to one of the groups shown below:

- Collections
  - Sequences
    1. String
    2. List
    3. Tuple
  - Mapping
    1. Dictionary
  - Set
- Numbers
  - Integer
    1. Boolean Value
  - Float
  - Complex
- None
