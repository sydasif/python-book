# 2. Basic of Python

This chapter focuses on the basic fundamentals of the Python programming language that are needed to write a program or a script. Python has different data types, sets, strings, lists and dictionaries that are important in programming. Lists store sequence of objects in an order and iterate over the list. Lists are dictionaries mutable, unlike tuple which are not mutable.

Variables in Python mainly refer to the storage location. These variables can be assigned one or more values. Python also has several data types including numeric data types and named constants. There are also a set of characters called strings that are contained in Python.

Lists in Python are sequences of ordered elements that are mutable. Sets, on the other hand, are Python collection of unordered elements that are immutable. Tuples are also Python elements that describe immutable objects but uses parenthesis.
