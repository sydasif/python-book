# Functions in Python

In python, like any other programming language, has some codes that are used more than once and need not to be rewritten over and over. This chapter discusses how the Python script can be made repeatable. These repeatable codes are called Functions.

The main objectives of this chapter is, to understand why and how programmers divide programs into sets of functions and to be able to define new functions in Python, lastly to understand the function calls and parameter.
