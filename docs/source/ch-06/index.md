# Functions in Python

Like any other programming language, has some codes that are used more than once and need not be rewritten over and over. This chapter discusses how the Python script can be made repeatable. These repeatable codes are called Functions.

The main objectives of this chapter are, to understand why and how programmers divide programs into sets of functions and to be able to define new functions in Python, lastly to understand the function calls and parameters.

Python is known to be an object oriented language. This is because almost everything is in Python is objects which are associated with properties and methods.
