# Exceptions and Errors

In this chapter, we will look at how to deal with errors and exceptions, in our code that can affect the normal execution of Python programs. We will address those situations and focus on finding out how these unexpected situations or errors can be handled. All of these errors can be managed using Pythonâ€™s built-in exception handling capabilities, `try` and `except` or `else` are called error handlers.
