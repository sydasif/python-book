# 1. Python and Network Automation

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and application development in many areas on most platforms.

Python language was developed by Guido van Rossum. Python has become a scripting language choice for Network Engineering tasks.

## Python Scripting Examples

As python scripting is a handy tool for network automation, typical manual tasks that can be automated are:

- Configuring switches
- Configuring routers
- Configuration changes
- Configuration management
- Troubleshooting

We need automation in networking to create a more efficient networking environment, improve network uptime and prevent mistakes. Network Automation is helping to solve the following:

- Mistakes due to human error in configuring the devices
- Repetitive tasks such as changing device logging credentials or time-based ACLs
- Allows to reproduce and dispose of logs which may cause devices to crash
- Deliver bug-free code on time

## Automation Tools and Languages

Python is used for network automation, but it’s frequently used with other network automation software tools for automating network monitoring, configurations and maintenance activities.

Some such tools are Ansible, Puppet, Chef and SatlStack which are discussed below:

Ansible is open-source software that helps to automate software configuration, management and application deployment. It can configure routers, switches and various types of servers.

Similarly, another open-source software, Puppet, is a good tool for configuration management. It runs on Microsoft Windows, and numerous Unix-like systems, and has its own declarative language too for system configuration description.

Chef is another tool for configuration management, written in Ruby and Erlang. It's built on a DevOps model and can help in building reliable scalable systems.

A Python-based open-source configuration management software, SatlStack, serves as a remote execution engine. As it uses the "Infrastructure as Code" methodology for deployment and cloud management, it is a competitive tool and can be used in the replacement of Puppet, Ansible, and Chef.

## What is Scripting?

Any programming language that supports a script is known as a scripting language. It helps programmers in order to write programs for a distinct environment to automate the execution of a number of tasks which could otherwise be executed manually by a human operator, one by one.
