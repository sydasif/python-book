# Why learn Programming?

Network engineering is fundamentally changing, as a network engineer, there has never been a better time for you to learn programming to automate networks and write code. In the late 90’s – 2010, a network engineer typed in the same CLI commands hundreds/thousands, of times to configure and troubleshoot network devices.

We have sighted improvements from network vendors, but also in the open source tooling that is available to use for automating the network. For example, there are now network devices APIs and community-supported Python libraries, and freely available open-source tools that give you and every other network engineer access to a growing environment to jump-start your network automation journey.

This means that you have to write less code than you would have in the past, and less code means faster development and fewer bugs, so we definitely think learning the basics of any programming language is valuable.

- An essential skill to enhance their capabilities.
- Programming to simplify or automate tasks.
- Knowing a programming language can come in handy.
- Manages network more efficiently.
- Software define networking
- Vendors heading towards software-based operations

## What is Scripting?

Any programming language that supports a script is known as a scripting language. It helps programmers to write programs for a distinct environment to automate the execution of several tasks which could otherwise be executed manually by a human operator, one by one.

## Scripting Examples

As python scripting is a handy tool for network automation, typical manual tasks that can be automated are:

- Configuring switches
- Configuring routers
- Configuration changes
- Configuration management
- Troubleshooting

We need automation in networking to create a more efficient networking environment, improve network uptime and prevent mistakes. Network Automation is helping to solve the following:

- Mistakes due to human error in configuring the devices
- Repetitive tasks such as changing device logging credentials or time-based ACLs
- Allows to reproduce and dispose of logs which may cause devices to crash
- Deliver bug-free code on time

## Automation and Orchestration

### Automation

- Well-specified task run on its own

### Orchestration

- Automating a lot of things at once
- Multiple tasks to execute a workflow
- Automation is the first step towards orchestration

## Automation Tools and Languages

Python is used for network automation, but it’s frequently used with other network automation software tools for automating network monitoring, configurations and maintenance activities. Some such tools are Ansible, Puppet, Chef and SatlStack which are discussed below:

- Ansible is open-source software that helps to automate software configuration, management and application deployment. It can configure routers, switches and various types of servers.

- Similarly, another open-source software, Puppet, is a good tool for configuration management. It runs on Microsoft Windows, and numerous Unix-like systems, and has its declarative language too for system configuration description.

- Chef is another tool for configuration management, written in Ruby and Erlang. It's built on a DevOps model and can help in building reliable scalable systems.

- A Python-based open-source configuration management software, SatlStack, serves as a remote execution engine. As it uses the "Infrastructure as Code" methodology for deployment and cloud management, it is a competitive tool and can be used in the replacement of Puppet, Ansible, and Chef.
