    "## Automation Tools and Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used for network automation, but itâ€™s frequently used with other network automation software tools for automating network monitoring, configurations and maintenance activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some such tools are Ansible, Puppet, Chef and SatlStack which are discussed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible is open-source software that helps to automate software configuration, management and application deployment. It can configure routers, switches and various types of servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, another open-source software, Puppet, is a good tool for configuration management. It runs on Microsoft Windows, and numerous Unix-like systems, and has its own declarative language too for system configuration description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chef is another tool for configuration management, written in Ruby and Erlang. It's built on a DevOps model and can help in building reliable scalable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python-based open-source configuration management software, SatlStack, serves as a remote execution engine. As it uses the \"Infrastructure as Code\" methodology for deployment and cloud management, it is a competitive tool and can be used in the replacement of Puppet, Ansible, and Chef."
