This chapter discusses the conditional statements which have prevalent use in programming. Conditional Statement in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific Boolean value evaluates to `True` or `False`. Conditional statements are handled by `if` statements in Python. In this same chapter we discuss Boolean expressions.

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in `if` statements and loops.
