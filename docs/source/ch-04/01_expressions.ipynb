    "\n",
    "Boolean expressions are expressions in Python programming language that produces a Boolean value when evaluated. The value can either be `True` or `False`. In Python, `False` maps to `0` (zero) and `True` maps to `1` (one). Boolean operations are used to control the flow of a program and make a comparison. Python also provides the `bool()` function, which allows you to cast other types to `True` or `False`.\n",
