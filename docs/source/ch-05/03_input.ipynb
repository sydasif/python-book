    "In Python, if we need to interact with users, either to get data input or to provide some sort of result. Asking the user to provide some type of input, Python provides us with built-in `input()` functions to take the input from the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string. It does not evaluate the expression, it just returns the complete statement as String. When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the userâ€™s input. When the user presses enter, the program resumes and returns what the user has typed.\n",
