# 3. Collections and Sequence

This chapter focuses on Collections and Sequences which is used to group multiple values together â€“ like a list of numbers, or a dictionary which can be used to store and retrieve key-value pairs.

A sequence is a group of items with a deterministic ordering. The order in which we put them in is the order in which we get an item out from them.

- String
- list
- tuples and range object

Python collection, unlike a sequence, does not have a deterministic ordering. In a collection, while ordering is arbitrary, physically, they do have an order. Every time we visit a set, we get its items in the same order. However, if we add or remove an item, it may affect the order.

- Dictionaries
- Set
