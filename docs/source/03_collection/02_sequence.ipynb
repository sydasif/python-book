    "\n",
    "One other major data structure in Python is Sequences. Itâ€™s worth noting that every sequence is a collection, but not every collection is a sequence. Sequences consist of strings, tuples and lists. Sequences have got two main features.\n",

    "- The first one is the slicing operation. This operation involves obtaining a certain number of items from a list.\n",
    "- Another operation is the indexing operation. Indexing operation allows a user to fetch a particular item or element in a list. It also gives a chance to perform operations on particular items."
