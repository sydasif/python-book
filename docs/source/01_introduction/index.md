# Python and Network Automation

Python language was developed by Guido van Rossum. Python has become a scripting language choice for network engineering to automate their tasks.

Python is an easy-to-learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s neat syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and application development in many areas on most platforms.
