This book is a guide for network engineers and is made for networkers to write casual code, so there’s not much time spent on style and beauty. Programming concepts—like object-oriented programming aren’t covered with details because of their complexity. But this book is mainly concerned with getting programs to work with the minimum amount of effort to automate networks.
