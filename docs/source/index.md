# What is Network Automation?

Network automation is the process of automating the configuration, management and operations of a computer network. The tasks that were normally done by the network or system administrator can be automated using a number of tools and technologies.

Scripting languages are widely used by Network and System administrators for automating the tasks. This saves time, effort and thereby reducing human errors as well. Among the automation tools, Python and Ansible are the most popular ones. With Software Defined Networking (SDN) in picture, knowing any of these programming languages is vital for the future of administering the network and systems.

There is a significant change in the networking industry which is driving networking engineers and organizations to adopt the concepts and ideas of network programmability and automation. To cater for the need for organizational competitiveness, it is highly recommended that networking professionals learn the scripting languages and protocols, as required for a new skill set.
